# Atomos

> A concise boilerplate for building experimental interconnected web apps

### Project Goal

The goal of the project is to create a simple boilerplate that allow the rapid prototyping of `experimental`, `interconnected web apps`
this means that the web applications built with atomos has the following properties:

1. `Lightweight` - Relatively small bundle size
2. `Performant` - The boilerplate is not design for large scale or even production level system, but it does promote being efficient
3. `Offline` - Apps built with atomos should ideally run under a local network
4. `Realtime` - the boilerplate has websockets built in to support realtime communication between devices.
